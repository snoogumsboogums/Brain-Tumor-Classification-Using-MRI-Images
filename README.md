This project uses the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle, which contains brain MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The objective of this project is to develop a classification model capable of detecting and identifying the type of brain tumor from MRI images.
